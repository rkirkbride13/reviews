School reports company

Write reports to find out how students did on tests

A comma Seperated string from schools, that contains values for test results

Would like to build a program that builds a report from that string

Input > Output:
"Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red" > "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 2"

"Green" > "Green: 1"

Test cases:

- If given an empty string, it should return an empty string

- If given a string with one report, it should give the grade of report and a single value (1)

- If given multiple reports, it sohuld give multiple grades with quantity of each grade
